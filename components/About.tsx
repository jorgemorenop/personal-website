                    Although it's nice having a place of my own to write
                    whatever I need, I must recognize that one of the main reasons for this to exist was that I wanted
                    to improve a bit my skills with React, Next.js, and web development in general (which were close to non-existent).

                {/*What do I offer:*/}

                {/*- Design and deploy architectures in the cloud: AWS (Solutions architect associate certification)*/}
                {/*and GCP.*/}
                {/*- Strong development fundaments: DevOps. Git. Advanced debugging and testing. Experience with agile*/}
                {/*methodology.*/}
                {/*- Strong Python and SQL. Experience working with Typescript, Java, Kotlin and C.*/}
                {/*- Experience modelling and manipulating data. Experience working with a broad range of databases*/}
                {/*(SQL, NoSQL, full text engines, data lakes & warehouses): PostgreSQL, Mon-goDB, DynamoDB, Firestore,*/}
                {/*Elasticsearch, Redshift, Athe-na/S3 and more.*/}
                {/*- Other technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, REST APIs, Spark, ML (keras, sklearn, â€¦), Ontology*/}
                {/*engineering.*/}

                {/*If you continue to be interested, do not hesitate to take a look on my profile. Either way, thank*/}
                {/*you for your time!*/}
