                        Mi name is Jorge Moreno, and I am a data engineer.

                        <br/>
                        I am currently working as a freelance in a per-project basis,
                        so feel free to contact me if you feel I could be of help with anything you have ðŸ™‚ (see below
                        for more info)

                        Although it is nice having a place of my own to write
                        whatever I need, I must recognize that one of the main reasons for this to exist was that I
                        wanted
                        to improve a bit my skills with React, Next.js, and web development in general (which were close
                        to non-existent).
