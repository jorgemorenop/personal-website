                    I'm an freelance software engineer from Spain. I've mostly worked as Data Engineer with a deeply use of Cloud environments (mostly AWS). I have also prior experience as Data Scientist. I consider myself an easy-going person, and I like a lot to help my co-workers in everything I can (if I can, of course). I enjoy learning new stuff and I also like to think that I’m quite good analyzing and solving problems.

What do I offer:

    - Design and deploy architectures in the cloud: AWS (Solutions architect associate certification) and GCP.
    - Strong development fundaments: DevOps. Git. Advanced debugging and testing. Experience with agile methodology.
    - Strong Python and SQL. Experience working with Typescript, Java, Kotlin and C.
    - Experience modelling and manipulating data. Experience working with a broad range of databases (SQL, NoSQL, full text engines, data lakes & warehouses): PostgreSQL, Mon-goDB, DynamoDB, Firestore, Elasticsearch, Redshift, Athe-na/S3 and more.
    - Other technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, REST APIs, Spark, ML (keras, sklearn, …), Ontology engineering.

If you continue to be interested, do not hesitate to take a look on my profile. Either way, thank you for your time!


## About this website
Yeah, it's handy to have your own site, but to be honest the main goal of building this website was to learn
more about React, Next.js, Typescript, and web development in general.
